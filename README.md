How we build and operate a regulated Banking-as-a-Service platform with a team of one human and many AI agents — the orchestration model, the guardrails, and the lessons that shaped them.

This is a methodology write-up, not a framework. Everything documented here runs in production today: the platform moves real money, so every pattern below exists because something cheaper failed first. The excerpts are real configuration, sanitized.

## The shape of the system

One human owner sets objectives and holds the keys to anything involving money, customers, or production. Everything else — design, implementation, testing, review, deployment to the development environment — is delegated to an orchestrated set of AI agents running under Claude Code, with an independent second LLM vendor (OpenAI Codex) acting as the reviewer of record before any merge.

```

Three layers keep this safe:

1. **Norms** — a project constitution (`CLAUDE.md`) and persistent memory files that encode the rules and the scar tissue behind them.
2. **Structure** — specialized agents with narrow jobs, skills that encode domain playbooks, and engineering loops with measured baselines and bounded retries.
3. **Walls** — deterministic hooks that deny dangerous tool calls outright: no pushes to protected branches, no destructive SQL, no merge without a cross-vendor approval recorded for the exact commit SHA.

## A day in the life of a change

A typical non-trivial change flows like this:

1. The owner states an objective ("customers need X"). Ambiguity about the *goal* triggers one clarifying round; ambiguity about the *how* does not — technical calls belong to the AI.
2. The main session checks whether a **skill** covers the domain (migrations, webhooks, provider features…) and loads it before touching code, then fans out **explore agents** to map the relevant code in parallel.
3. A **planner agent** on the strongest model designs the approach; **executor agents** on a cheaper model implement it, in parallel where file ownership is disjoint.
4. A **guardian agent** validates lint, types, build, and tests after every meaningful batch of edits.
5. Verification is against the *actual job*, not proxies: a test that goes red→green, a call against the deployed function, a screenshot of the UI doing the thing. "Should work" is banned vocabulary.
6. A PR opens. In parallel with CI, **Codex — a different model vendor — reviews the exact diff** with a skeptical SHIP/BLOCK prompt. A merge-gate hook physically blocks the merge until a SHIP verdict is recorded for the PR's exact head commit; any new commit invalidates it.
7. Merge to the development branch *is* the deploy (CI/CD). The session reports back with evidence and stops at the hard stop: promoting toward customer-facing environments requires an explicit human OK, every time.

Total human involvement: the objective at the start, the promotion decision at the end, and any genuine business/risk calls in between.

## Copy-pasteable examples

The [`examples/`](examples/) directory contains genericized, directly usable versions of the real configuration:

| Directory | Contents |
|---|---|
| [`examples/claude-md/`](examples/claude-md/) | A project-constitution template (`CLAUDE.md`) distilled from the production one — kept small (~200 lines) on purpose |
| [`examples/rules/`](examples/rules/) | Path-scoped rules that auto-load only when a matching file is read — how the constitution stays small |
| [`examples/hooks/`](examples/hooks/) | The guardrail hooks: protected-branch pushes, destructive SQL, deploy bypasses, and the cross-vendor merge gate |
| [`examples/agents/`](examples/agents/) | The five agent definitions: orchestrator, guardian, loop planner/executor/verifier |
| [`examples/skills/`](examples/skills/) | A skill template plus two complete playbooks (safe migrations, webhook systems) |
| [`examples/codex-review-rubric.md`](examples/codex-review-rubric.md) | The rules-based rubric that hardens the cross-vendor SHIP/BLOCK review |
| [`examples/loops/`](examples/loops/) | Immutable feature lists + a fail-closed checker for long-horizon, multi-session work |
| [`examples/memory/`](examples/memory/) | The memory system: index template and one-fact-per-file memory examples |

## The principles in one paragraph

Give the AI a clear objective and full technical autonomy inside hard walls. Make "done" verifiable by command, never by opinion. Never let the model that wrote the code judge whether it merges — use a different vendor and enforce the verdict with a deterministic hook, not a promise. Encode every lesson where it can't be forgotten: incidents become memories, memories become rules, and the worst ones become hooks. Spend strong-model tokens on design and judgment, cheap-model tokens on mechanical execution, and human attention only where money, customers, or irreversibility are involved.

## What this is not

- Not a framework or library — the only things to install are the sanitized configs in [`examples/`](examples/), and those are starting points, not dependencies.
- Not a claim that this is the only way — it's the way that survived contact with a production financial system.
- Not the full configuration of our platform — excerpts are sanitized and simplified; platform-identifying details are deliberately absent.
